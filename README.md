_SealedApiResults has been archived in favor of [HttpMonads](https://github.com/nhaarman/httpmonads)_.

SealedApiResults utilizes Kotlin's sealed classes to provide a safe way of handling http network calls.

## Example

```kotlin
fun onResult(result: SealedApiResult<String>) =
    when(result) {
      is Ok200 -> println(result.body)
      is Unauthorized401 -> println("Unauthorized")
      is Some -> println("Unhandled response: ${result.code}")
      is NetworkError -> result.e.printStackTrace()
    }
```

The compiler will complain when you forget to handle a case, such as the `NetworkError`.
This makes for a very safe way of dealing with network results.

## Install

SealedApiResults is available on JCenter.
